# Arduino-RFID-door-lock
Arduino based  RFID door lock.
This was my college Senior class capstone project. I wanted to find an affordable way that anyone with enough spare time, could implement an RFID based door lock. I decided to use an Arduino as a basic webserver and the RFID controller. I designed, built, and implemented the RFID controller my self. I learned a lot from this project and thought this code might help people building similar projects.
